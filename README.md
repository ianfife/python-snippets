Simple python programs from/inspired by my Cryptography class.

# Class Projects
## [100 Words](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/100Words.py)
This program converts a list of words to values and then finds all the words that have a value of 100.

## [Baconian Cipher V1](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/BaconianCipherV1.py)
This program encrypts and decrypts messages using the Baconian Cipher. It substitutes letters with a string of five binary digits.

## [Caesar Brute Force](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/CaesarBruteForce.py)
This program brute forces all possible decryptions of an encrypted message using the Caesar Cipher.


## [Find Palindromes](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/FindPalindromes/FindPalindromes.py)
This program finds palindromes from a list of words.

## [Find 100 Palindromes](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/FindPalindromes/Find100Palindromes.py)
This program finds palindromes from a list of words, and tests if any of them have a value of 100.

## [Money Words](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/MoneyWords.py)
This program converts a list of words to values and then finds the word with thte biggest value.

## [Rail Cipher](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/RailCipher.py)
This program performs both encryption and decryption with a key 2 rail cipher.

## [Shift Cipher V1 Decrypt](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/ShiftCipherV1/ShiftCipherV1Decrypt.py)
This program decrypts shift ciphers.

## [Shift Cipher V1 Encrypt](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/ShiftCipherV1/ShiftCipherV1Encrypt.py)
This program encrypts shift ciphers.

## [Shift Cipher V1 Full](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/ShiftCipherV1/ShiftCipherV1Full.py)
This program both encrypts and decrypts shift ciphers.

## [Shift Cipher V2](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/ShiftCipherV2.py)
This program encrypts and decrypts using a large array of symbols.

## [Shift Cipher V3](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/ShiftCipherv3.py)
This program modifies the standard encryption/decryption program by adding an additional "password phrase" to the symbol set. Each character in the phrase (no repeats) is appended at the LEFT side of the symbol list, and the corresponding characters are removed from their normal location in the symbol set. In this way, the ORDER of the symbol set is unique based on the pass phrase.

## [Sum of Letters](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Class/SumOfLetters.py)
This program adds the entire sum of letters in a word.

# Personal Projects

## [Caesar Shift](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Personal/CaesarShift.py)
This program performs a basic caesar shift encryption.

## [Find Palindromes V2](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Personal/FindPalindromesV2.py)
This program finds palindromes from a list of words. It uses a much simpler method of finding palindromes compared to the original.

## [Smart Caesar Brute Force](https://github.com/ianfife/python-snippets/blob/main/Personal/SmartCaesarBruteForce.py)
This program brute forces all possible decryptions of an encrypted message and then attempts to present the most likely true decryption to the user.
